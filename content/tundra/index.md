description: Tundra is well socialized and friendly but can take some time to warm-up and trust new friends. If you see us and would like to meet her, let us know! Also, to Tundra's good friends, please help us improve her jumping habit by giving her attention when she's "4-on-the-floor (sidewalk)" or asking her to sit.
    Parents are Chris and Kate
